# DApp: Attempting to detect disease outbreak using a distributed application

@Jaskirat: 
Before running the app, we need to do the following:
1. Copy the code in .sol file to remix IDE
2. Hardcode the ABI from Remix IDE (Compile -> Details -> ABI) in the app.js code.
3. Hardcode the address from the Run instance in the app.js code.
4. Run the blockchain in a terminal window in developer and mine mode (geth --dev --mine --rpc --unlock=0)
5. The app starts but running app.js. In a new terminal window write "node app"
Check which port the app works on. Open a browser window and enter in the URL field: "localhost:port-number"

Leave me a issue if you face a problem.
